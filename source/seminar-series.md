### Columbia University Environmental Engineering Summer Seminar Series

For 2021, we are pleased to introduce the inaugural Earth and
Environmental Engineering Summer Seminar Series at Columbia
University. This graduate student-run seminar series features research
from early career researchers.

#### Seminar Series Goals

- Represent the emerging diversity in our field.
- Share new ideas and build community between students based here in
  our department and researchers around the globe.
- Provide a space for young, innovative, and open-minded researchers
  to participate in a seminar series. Many other seminar series tend
  to invite senior researchers, and we are excited to host and engage
  with a seminar series that breaks from that tradition. Inspirations
  include the [Distinguished Young Scholars
  Seminar](http://depts.washington.edu/dyss/index.html) hosted by the
  University of Washington's Chemical Engineering department, and the
  [Graduate Climate
  Conference](https://pcc.uw.edu/events/graduate-climate-conference/).


This seminar series is organized by:

- Sara Hamilton
- Chae Jeong-Potter
- Adam Massmann
- Ian Billinge
- Monica Abdallah
