### Columbia University Environmental Engineering Summer Seminar Series

For 2021, we are pleased to introduce the inaugural Earth and
Environmental Engineering Summer Seminar Series at Columbia
University. This graduate student-run seminar series **hosts early
career researchers (Ph.D. students and recent Ph.D. graduates [within
5 years]).**

The goals of this seminar series are to:

- Represent the emerging diversity in our field.
- Share new ideas and build community between students in our
  department and researchers around the globe.
- Provide a space for young, innovative, and open-minded researchers
  to participate in a seminar
  series. Many other seminar series tend to invite senior researchers
  that have been socialized for many years in academia, and we are
  excited to host and engage with a seminar series that breaks from
  that tradition. Inspirations include the [Distinguished Young
  Scholars Seminar](http://depts.washington.edu/dyss/index.html) hosted by the University of Washington's Chemical
  Engineering department, and the [Graduate Climate Conference](https://pcc.uw.edu/events/graduate-climate-conference/).

If you are interested in speaking during the seminar series, **please
fill out [this short
application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1x05IPe6zoQbrJ5OSldxM5aMGrGUGwOI1Ex4qCCRw914)**. We
hope this application is not too tedious (and we apologize if it is);
our motivation for the open application is to insure that seminar
speakers are not limited to those already in our professional and
social networks. Speakers will be selected and notified in late
April/early May, and presentations will be scheduled for June-early
August 2021, over Zoom. While our department focuses on environmental
engineering, we welcome submissions from related fields in
environmental impacts and environmental science.

For the selected speakers, potential benefits of participation
include:

- A relatively low stakes, intimate venue to practice the type of
  seminar presentation common during faculty hiring processes.
- Feedback from graduate and undergraduate students (optional but
  available if the speaker would value it).
- An opportunity to make meaningful connections with fellow young
  researchers in our department.
- An official "invited-speaker" invitation to present in the seminar
  series.

If you have any questions please reach out to Adam Massmann
(akm2203@columbia.edu) and/or Sara Hamilton (sth2128@columbia.edu).
