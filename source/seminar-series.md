### Columbia University Environmental Engineering Summer Seminar Series

For 2021, we are pleased to introduce the inaugural Earth and
Environmental Engineering Summer Seminar Series at Columbia
University. This graduate student-run seminar series **hosts early
career researchers (Ph.D. students and recent Ph.D. graduates [within
5 years and without a tenure-track appointment]).**

The goals of this seminar series are to:

- Represent the emerging diversity in our field.
- Share new ideas and build community between students based here in
  our department and researchers around the globe.
- Provide a space for young, innovative, and open-minded researchers
  to participate in a seminar series. Many other seminar series tend
  to invite senior researchers, and we are excited to host and engage
  with a seminar series that breaks from that tradition. Inspirations
  include the [Distinguished Young Scholars
  Seminar](http://depts.washington.edu/dyss/index.html) hosted by the
  University of Washington's Chemical Engineering department, and the
  [Graduate Climate
  Conference](https://pcc.uw.edu/events/graduate-climate-conference/).

Our application for interested speakers is now closed. Speakers will
be selected and notified by May 24th, and presentations will be
scheduled for June-early August 2021, over Zoom. Thank you to all of
the potential speakers that applied!
