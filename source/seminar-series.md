### Environmental Engineering Graduate Summer Seminar Series

For 2021, we are pleased to introduce the inaugural Environmental
Engineering Graduate Summer Seminar Series. This graduate student-run
seminar series **hosts early career researchers (Ph.D. students and
recent Ph.D. graduates [within 5 years]).**

The goals of this seminar series are to:

- Represent the emerging diversity in our field.
- Share new ideas and build community between students based here in
  New York and around the globe.
- Provide a space for young, innovative, and open-minded researchers
  to participate in a seminar series. Many other seminar series tend
  to invite senior researchers that have been socialized for many
  years in academia, and we are excited to host and engage with a
  seminar series that breaks from that tradition. Inspirations include
  the [Distinguished Young Scholars
  Seminar](http://depts.washington.edu/dyss/index.html) hosted by the
  University of Washington's Chemical Engineering department, and the
  [Graduate Climate
  Conference](https://pcc.uw.edu/events/graduate-climate-conference/).

If you are interested in speaking during the seminar series, **please
fill out [this short
application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1x05IPe6zoQbrJ5OSldxM5aMGrGUGwOI1Ex4qCCRw914)**.
Our motivation for the open application is to insure that seminar
speakers are not limited to those already in our professional and
social networks. Speakers will be selected and notified in late
April/early May, and presentations will be scheduled for June-early
August 2021, over Zoom. While our active research areas include
**energy** (renewable energy and grid integration, electrochemical
energy storage, carbon capture utilization and storage), **water**
(climate and risk mitigation of water systems, desalination,
biological waste water treatment, global hydrology and land-atmosphere
interactions) and **sustainable materials** (recycling and reuse, rare
earth element extraction, climate and water risks associated with
mining operations), we additionally welcome submissions from related
fields in environmental impacts and environmental science.

For the selected speakers, potential benefits of participation
include:

- A relatively low stakes, intimate venue to practice the type of
  seminar presentation common during faculty hiring processes.
- Feedback from graduate and undergraduate students (optional but
  available if the speaker would value it).
- An opportunity to make meaningful connections with fellow young
  researchers based in and around New York.
- An official "invited-speaker" invitation to present in the seminar
  series.
