### Columbia University Environmental Engineering Summer Seminar Series

For 2021, we are pleased to introduce the inaugural Earth and
Environmental Engineering Summer Seminar Series at Columbia
University. This graduate student-run seminar series **hosts early
career researchers (Ph.D. students and recent Ph.D. graduates [within
5 years and without a tenure-track appointment]).**

The goals of this seminar series are to:

- Represent the emerging diversity in our field.
- Share new ideas and build community between students based here in
  our department and researchers around the globe.
- Provide a space for young, innovative, and open-minded researchers
  to participate in a seminar series. Many other seminar series tend
  to invite senior researchers, and we are excited to host and engage
  with a seminar series that breaks from that tradition. Inspirations
  include the [Distinguished Young Scholars
  Seminar](http://depts.washington.edu/dyss/index.html) hosted by the
  University of Washington's Chemical Engineering department, and the
  [Graduate Climate
  Conference](https://pcc.uw.edu/events/graduate-climate-conference/).

We are thrilled to announce our invited speakers for 2021:

- Hollie Adejumo
- Harsh Agarwal
- Steven Chavez
- Devon Kerins
- Anna Kogler
- Chinomso Onuoha
- Solomon Oyakhire
- Enrique Rodriguez
- Qianhong Zhu

If you would like to attend the seminar series, please fill out this
