This website is provided for EEE students, by EEE students. Please see

    Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15XLTX804nb2GqjX6Kyi9Y8hvwzYY8rXKRRRxKpaKTIQ/edit) -
    this is the place to document changes to the program, and also the
    source of the most up to date information on program requirements.
    Every year, updated orientation slides will be built from this
    document.
-   [EAEE PhD Student
    Resources](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1G9RP-Xpefz0XbgiVjvUEUR8BPmGeOqkGRgEAM-SHsbk) -
    contact information of EAEE graduate students, as well as general
    resources for students.
-   [EAEE Ph.D. Resource
    Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16vFLRhV8zds_UYv3W_SXswAD45no8QEu) -
    folder for any materials that do not fit into the above Google Doc.
-   [EAEE Graduate Student Inclusion and Anti-Racism
    Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIPLfSkA6XfdMGeDzCCie-P64uCCdM9KRt-2Kk65opE/edit?usp=sharing) -
    resources on combating racism and bias, and promoting inclusion
    within EAEE.
-   [EAEE observed and experienced acts of
    exclusion](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdR1lVWkQGeObLfnAO-PTuud9QCJEtHjJwfovjQGg-ejh5Mew/viewform?usp=sf_link) -
    an anonymous form to report any observed or experienced acts of
    exclusion. If you wish, one of Ian, Kinnari, Chae, or Adam will talk
    to the people causing the exclusion, with the goal of correcting in
    in the future. We want EAEE\'s impact to match its intention of
    being an inclusive community. Also, if anonymity is not important to
    you, and/or you would like to discuss in person, you can reach out
    to Ian (ihb2106), Kinnari (kms2313), Chae (cj2563), and/or Adam
    (akm2203) directly to talk.
