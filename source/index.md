#### Feedback and Contributions

We are hoping to continually refine the website structure and content,
so feedback and ideas for more content are very welcome. Please email
[Adam](http://www.columbia.edu/~akm2203/) (akm2203@columbia.edu) if
you have any questions or comments. Or even better yet, if you would
like to edit the website directly, please see the [source on
Github](https://github.com/massma/eee-grad-website). (and if you have
questions on how to edit the website source, Adam is happy to walk you
through that).

#### History

This website has grown, with community contributions, from a website
originally put together by the participants of a [Center for Teaching
and Learning (CTL)](https://ctl.columbia.edu/)-sponsored workshop on
TA documentation. Thank you to the CTL for their support and funding!
