Columbia EEE TA Student Resources
---------------------------------------

This website hosts documentation for EAEE TAs. The website is provided
for EAEE students, by EAEE students.

**Contributions are enthusiastically encouraged!** Please feel free to
edit any of the Google documents and add files to any of the
folders. Because of the sensitivity of materials, the course-specific
materials are all password protected, but if you are the TA for that
course and need permissions just request permission through Google or
email Adam (uni:akm2203) he will fix that!

### General EAEE TA resources (not course-specific)

### Contributing guidelines for course-specific materials

For file uploads to the Google Drive folder in course-specific
repositories, please add a dated prefix to the filename of the form
\"YYYY-Semester-filename.extension.\" Please **do not include any
spaces** in the filename. For example, if I was uploading a picture of
the first midterm solutions for Fall of 2019 I would call the file:

\"2019-Fall-midterm1-solutions.jpg\"

Or if I was uploading a pdf of the first Problem Set for a course in
Spring of 2020, I would call the file:

\"2020-Spring-ps1.pdf\"

Please reach out to Adam (uni: akm2203) if you have any questions.

If you already have a course repository hosted on another platform like
Github or Dropbox, you can continue to host the repository on that
platform. Just add a Google document to the Google drive folder with a
link to the external repository and instructions for how to obtain
access/edit permissions.

### Ideas of course-specific materials to Document

-   **Contact information**
-   **TA responsibilities and weekly time spent on each responsibility
    (on average)**. The department does not tell TAs how much time they
    will spend on a course. Documenting how much time you spent (on
    average) as a TA is a way for future TAs to get an idea of how much
    time they will spend, so they can plan accordingly.
-   **Solutions to problem sets and exams**, and any other answer keys.
    Many TAs needlessly repeat work by generating the same set of
    solutions as previous years\' TAs.
-   **Grading rubrics**. Grading rubrics make the grading process more
    efficient, help mediate grading disagreements with students, and
    improve course consistency year-to-year. Creating grading rubrics
    can save you time, and adding them to the course repository can save
    future TAs time.
-   **Learning Objectives**. Learning objectives are what you hope
    students will gain from a course, lesson, or problem set. Defining
    learning objectives before making assessments and lessons can help
    make sure course elements are working in service of the learning
    objectives (this is called \"backwards design\").
-   **Revised problem sets and lab activities**. Consider revising
    problem sets again *after* grading for the benefit of next year\'s
    TAs. For example, if an ambiguous question created issues during
    grading, revise the question to be less ambiguous and post it to the
    repository.
-   **Course notes, lecture slides and syllabus.** Self explanatory, but
    documenting can save future TAs time, and improve the quality of the
    course through iterative refinement.
-   **Student FAQ (and answers)**. Many students ask the same questions;
    documenting the answers to those questions can save future TAs the
    time needed to re-craft the same answers. Also through iteration we
    can improve the answers to frequently asked questions year after
    year.
-   **Course specific recommended boundaries.** Setting clear boundaries
    is important for the mental health of both TAs and students.
    Providing a list of boundaries that made the course run smoother can
    help future TAs\' courses run smoother (e.g., only ask questions
    over Piazza instead of email, only answer questions during certain
    times of the day like 9-5, etc.).
-   **Recommendations for successfully working with/for course
    professors**. Every person is different and has their own management
    and organization styles. As we work with someone through the
    semester, we learn the best way to work with them given their style.
    Documenting how you improved your working relationship can help
    future TAs successfully work with faculty.
